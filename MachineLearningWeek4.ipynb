Here are the steps for a classification task:\n","\n","1.  **Choose a value for K**: This is the number of nearest neighbors to consider. A smaller K makes the model sensitive to noise, while a larger K might smooth out the decision boundary too much.\n","2.  **Calculate Distance**: For a new, unclassified data point, calculate its distance to all other data points in the training dataset. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.\n","3.  **Find K Nearest Neighbors**: Select the K data points from the training set that are closest (have the smallest distances) to the new data point.\n","4.  **Vote for Classification**: For classification, count the number of data points in each class among these K neighbors.\n","5.  **Assign Class**: Assign the new data point to the class that has the majority vote among the K nearest neighbors. In case of a tie, different tie-breaking rules can be applied (e.g., choose the class with the smallest average distance to the new point, or choose arbitrarily).\n","\n","KNN is a 'lazy' algorithm because it doesn't build a model during the training phase; instead, it stores the entire training dataset and performs computations only when a prediction is requested."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":482},"id":"760a54d3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771840671853,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3117,"user":{"displayName":"Poorvi Naveen","userId":"15808753066970133890"}},"outputId":"62e2ae3f-60cf-463e-892f-fc05efe468c5"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n","\n","# 1.
